tic tac toe game, part of [TheOdinProject](https://theodinproject.com)'s curriculum.
I'm sure I'll laugh at this code in a couple of years after I get more coding experience but I'm proud of this thing. I'll make a v2 with better code and smarter AI once I get more experience.

## Stuff I learned

- Manipulating the DOM is so fun I can't wait to master it.
- Not using global variables.
- moving between different pages without loading multiple html files.
- more stuff...
